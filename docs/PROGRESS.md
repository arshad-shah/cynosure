# Cynosure progress

## Status

Plan 3 (Milestone 2 structure and overlays) in progress on `next`: Tasks 1–7 done. Plans 1 and 2 complete. Storybook live at https://arshad-shah.github.io/cynosure/.

Done in Plan 3:

- **Task 1:** Stack, Inline and the `useRovingFocus` hook.
- **Task 2:** Card.
- **Task 3:** Toolbar.
- **Task 4:** Tabs, with overflow fades, closable tabs, and auto or manual activation.
- **Task 5:** Disclosure and Accordion. The height animates without script; headers are headings and open sections are regions.
- **Task 6:** Popover and `useDismiss`. One layer stack: Escape closes the topmost layer, outside clicks close, and focus returns. Tooltip joined the stack.
- **Task 7:** Menu, with arrows, type-ahead, sections, checkable items and shortcuts.

Also shipped in this stretch:

- **Docs pages:** every component and foundation has a hand-written docs page (`<Name>.mdx`) and there is no autodocs. Tables use GFM, and `cy check` enforces a docs page and no text glyphs in docs.
- **TextArea:** hand-made resize grip.
- **Fields:** a `labelHidden` option, alignment kept beside error messages, and a sunken fill for read-only fields.
- **Input variants:** a contract story checks that inputs and buttons line up at every size.
- **Plan 2 review fixes:**
  - Select: a disabled or invalid Select now behaves like the native one in forms.
  - Colour mode: synced across instances and hydration-safe.
  - Select list: aligned to the trigger, and long labels truncate.
- **Firefox focus flakes:** root-caused (the test frame was not focused). Each story now calls `window.focus()` before it runs. Firefox runs in its own pass and there are no retries.

## Current task

Plan 3 Task 8: DialogBase (foundation wrapping `<dialog>`), Dialog and Sheet. Not started.

## Next step

Continue Plan 3 at Task 8 (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-09-cynosure-structure.md`):

1. **Dialog:** write the DialogBase, Dialog and Sheet stories first. Cover:
   - focus trapped and returned
   - Escape closes unless `dismissible={false}`
   - a backdrop click closes it
   - inner content scrolls
   - narrow container becomes a bottom sheet
   - a nested Menu closes first
   - no writes to `body`
   - works in a shadow root
2. **Implement on the shared layer:** use `useDismiss` from `src/overlay/dismiss.ts`, and use `showModal` for the top layer.
3. **Remaining tasks:**
   - **Task 9:** Toast
   - **Task 10:** Notice and EmptyState
   - **Task 11:** CopyButton
   - **Task 12:** carry-overs: React 18 fixture smoke test, dark-contrast baselines
   - **Task 13:** docs, PROGRESS and push
4. **Final whole-branch review** for Plan 3, then Plan 4.

The resume ledger lives in `.superpowers/sdd/2026-11-09-cynosure-structure/progress.md` (git-ignored, local only). Rulings are also summarised below.

## Plans

- [x] Plan 1: Foundation (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-09-cynosure-foundation.md`)
- [x] Plan 2: Milestone 1 controls (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-09-cynosure-controls.md`)
- [ ] Plan 3: Milestone 2 structure and overlays (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-09-cynosure-structure.md`). Tasks 1–7 done, Task 8 next.
- [ ] Plan 4: Milestone 3 and product migration issues (not written)

## Plan 3 rulings so far

- **Roving focus:** `useRovingFocus` reads the text direction from the container (there is no `rtl` option). The Tab stop follows the selection while focus is elsewhere, and text inputs keep their arrow keys.
- **Card:** interactive only through `href` (LinkBase) or `onClick` (ButtonBase). Card owns its type scale.
- **Toolbar:** radios inside are separate stops (APG toolbar).
- **Tabs:**
  - horizontal only
  - tabs without a TabPanel omit `aria-controls`
  - budget 4.5 kB including the shared roving hook
- **Disclosure:** animates `grid-template-rows` from 0fr to 1fr. Closed content is `visibility: hidden`, so find-in-page will not open it.
- **Accordion:** regions on by default, `regions={false}` for long lists. Budget 3.25 kB including Disclosure.
- **Popover:** the trigger is a render prop.
- **Layer stack:** the topmost layer is the most recently opened one with no open layer nested inside it.
- **Overlay budget:** the overlay core is budgeted once at 2 kB.
- **Menu:** checkable items keep it open, and disabled items are skipped by arrows.
- **Docs:** no autodocs, hand-written MDX per component, and words instead of arrow glyphs.

## Feedback round (2026-11-09, after Plan 1)

- **LoadingDots:** its own component of three pulsing dots, with size, tone, colour and speed, visible under reduced motion. Button reuses it.
- **Button API:** `variant` (solid, soft, outline, ghost) × `tone` (accent, neutral, danger, success, warning, info). Every pair is tested distinct and ≥ 4.5:1.
- **Colours:** ember brand accent `#c2410c` with white text, crimson danger (`#b4235a` / `#ff6b8f`), and per-tone text roles.
- **Brand:** logo and lockup recoloured to ember; wordmark readable on light backgrounds; PNG and ICO regenerated.
- **Icons:** Facet icons are stroke only (accent dot removed). 136 icons in 15 categories with a categorised gallery.
- **Props:** shared prop vocabulary (`size`, `tone`, `variant`, `color`) in `docs/conventions.md` and the `cy new component` template, with Storybook controls for every prop.

## Feedback round (2026-11-09, during Plan 3)

- **Visual checks:** check everything visually, and make the variants of inputs good. This led to `labelHidden`, alignment beside errors, the read-only fill, the input-variants contract and vertical Toolbar alignment.
- **Docs pages:** they must explain the component, not repeat stories. This led to hand-written MDX for all components and foundations, plus the `cy check` docs rule.
- **TextArea:** must be resizable. It now has a hand-made grip.
- **Tables:** markdown tables in docs rendered as raw text. Fixed with remark-gfm, and a test guards it.

## Plan 2 notes (2026-11-09)

- **`inherit-chain` rule:** new `cy check` rule. Every element with a `cy-` class carries `.cy-reset` or declares its font size; it found 10 real host-CSS leaks.
- **Overlays:** Tooltip and Select use the Popover API (top layer) with a shared positioner (`src/overlay`), so overlays work in shadow roots and never clip.
- **Build output:** the library ships minified ESM with sourcemaps, and `"use client"` only on interactive modules.

## Blockers

None. Npm publish and deprecating the old packages wait for Arshad's authorisation.

## Decision log

- **2026-11-09 (setup):**
  - Single package `@arshad-shah/cynosure` on branch `next`.
  - Facet icons and Facet look approved.
  - English strings with `labels` overrides.
- **2026-11-09 (Arshad's feedback):**
  - Remove the accent dot from icons (stroke only).
  - One prop vocabulary across components.
  - The loading indicator is its own component (three pulsing dots).
- **2026-11-09 (stack):** React components (Preact via compat), plain modern CSS, and tokens in TS → CSS. No web components (content-script registry).
- **2026-11-09 (toolchain):** Vite 8, Vitest 5, Storybook 10.6 and TypeScript 5.9 (not 7, because the tooling uses the TS API). pnpm refuses packages younger than 14 days.
- **2026-11-09 (security):** theme input is validated centrally, and gamut mapping is bounded.
- **2026-11-09 (CSS):** component roots never carry `.cy-reset` (found by the hostile-host and shadow-root tests).
- **2026-11-09 (attribution):** no AI attribution in commits, PRs or issues.
- **2026-11-09 (Plan 1 final review fixes):**
  - component roots use doubled selectors (Tailwind v3 `[type=button]`)
  - tokens only on `:root`/`:host`, so nested themes inherit
  - no `color-scheme` on the host `<html>`
  - hover and active states move away from on-accent text
  - transparent focus outline for forced colors
  - coverage floor 95%
- **2026-11-09 (visual baselines):** Chromium on Linux. Refresh by pushing a commit to `next` containing `[baselines]` (dispatch needs the workflow on `main`).
- **2026-11-09 (Plan 2 review):** six Important findings fixed. The deferred minors are listed in the Plan 2 final review section of the controls ledger.
- **2026-11-09 (Plan 3):** docs pages are hand-written. Firefox stories run in their own pass, with `window.focus()` before each story and no retries.

## Verification

- **Local `pnpm verify`** (latest): 283 unit tests, 477 story runs (Chromium, WebKit, touch) and 233 Firefox runs; coverage ≥ 95% branches.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions on Linux runs conventions, lint, types, unit tests, stories on all three engines plus touch, coverage, visual regression, build, publint, attw and size. The status of the latest push is not yet confirmed.
- **Not verified:**
  - real extension contexts (Prism and Aperture shadow roots under MV3 CSP)
  - Safari and Edge outside the Playwright engines
  - the React 18 runtime (Task 12)
